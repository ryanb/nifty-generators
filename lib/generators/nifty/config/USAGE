Description:
    The nifty_config generator creates YAML file in your config
    directory and an initializer to load this config. The config has a
    separate section for each environment. This is a great place to put
    any config settings you don't want in your app.

    The config is loaded into a constant called APP_CONFIG by default,
    this changes depending on the name you choose to pass the generator.
    Use this constant to access the config settings like this.

    APP_CONFIG[:some_setting]


Examples:
    rails generate nifty:config

        Config:      config/app_config.yml
        Initializer: config/initializers/load_app_config.rb

    rails generate nifty:config passwords

        Config:      config/passwords_config.yml
        Initializer: config/initializers/load_passwords_config.rb
